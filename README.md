# password-generator
Applying what we've learned about javascript to create a password generator.

## Description
In the modern day, web security is more important than ever. Weak passwords that are easy to guess or commonly reused passwords leave people vulnerable. Some devices or browsers have built in automatic password generators, but those require no input from the user. This password generator allows the user to define the length of their password, as well as what characters they'd like to be included from lowercase letters, uppercase letters, integers, and special characters. The password generated should include at least one of every chosen character type.
